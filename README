// Knock Lock

In this project, you will be working on your own secret locking mechanism to keep unwanted
guests out of your space!!!

The secret knocker uses a piezo element to record and etect your secret knock patturn, then
turns a servo motor that you can connect to your door lock.

Here, a switch will let you loc the motor in place

some LEDs will give your status: a red LED will indicate the door is locked, a green LED will
indicate the door is unlocked, and a yellow LED lets your know if a valid knock has been received/
